UN Project Proposal --> Alex R. 

UNDP - development program 
     -- poverty reduction
     -- environmental
     -- conflict perversion
     	:: build national capacity, local grassroots NGO to be able to prevent and manage their own conflict. Supporting mediate efforts to bring different actors to lessen conflict
	   :: dispel belief that UNDP is a "police", they're helpers of local government.
Global Post
       -- the think tank of the UNDP
       -- mediators between the two. 
       -- short study in Tunisia, to get what is in the data. 

What do they want
     --Conflict: the goldstein scale (looking at the negative and positive) and CAMEO. 
how far do the trends go? -to- 2012 elections in Georgia. 
    --What can the GDELT data tell us that we didn't know in terms of the four causes for conflict.
    	   â€¢ what inside GDELT could be used to proxy conflict.
	   -- What are the things that can apply to different types of conflict 
	   -- What are the key areas of tension that happened in Georgia that we can keep an eye on for the next elections. 
	   -- Focus on the predictability of violence in terms of knowing which parties will clash. 
In Tunisia
   -- Does the GDELT dataset reflect the events that we already know about
   -- Georgia context to see whether the historical conflicts match the ones in GDELT.

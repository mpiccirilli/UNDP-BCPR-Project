#The code below is used to download the GDELT datasets in R and subset for all actions that have taken place in Georgia.
#You must have the package GDELTtools installed in order to run the first line.  Below is an example for 1979 data only.
#For recent years I would recommend only downloading one month at a time since the files are so large
